## WiMap Version 1.1.0

This update addresses two key issues: permanent image deletion and live updates for pinned cards.

### Image Deletion

Previously, when a user removed an attached image from a Wi-Fi card, it would be restored automatically on the next scan. This has been fixed. Now, when an image is deleted, it is permanently removed from both storage and memory and will not reappear in future scans or sessions. This applies to both pinned and unpinned cards.

### Live Updates for Pinned Cards

Any change made to a pinned network card (e.g., password, comment, image) in the main list is now immediately reflected in the Pinned screen. This ensures that the Pinned screen always displays the most up-to-date data.
