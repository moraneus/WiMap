# Temporary Network Data Persistence Fix

## Problem Statement
When a user **attaches an image**, **writes a comment**, or **enters a password** on a Wi-Fi card during a scan — but **does not pin the card** — all of that information currently **disappears after the scan refreshes**.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Infrastructure (Already Existed)
The app already had a robust database infrastructure for temporary network data:

- **TemporaryNetworkData** entity with fields for:
  - `bssid` (Primary Key)
  - `ssid`
  - `comment`
  - `savedPassword`
  - `photoPath`
  - `isPinned`
  - `lastUpdated`

- **TemporaryNetworkDataDao** with CRUD operations
- **TemporaryNetworkDataRepository** and implementation
- **ManageTemporaryNetworkDataUseCase** for business logic

### 2. Data Flow Integration (Fixed)
The main issue was in the **WifiNetworkCard** component, which wasn't properly using the temporary data from the database. 

#### Key Changes Made:

**WifiNetworkCard.kt:**
- Fixed initialization to use network data (which includes merged temporary data from database)
- Updated state management to properly sync with temporary data
- Fixed nullable type issues with PinnedNetwork data

```kotlin
// Initialize from network data (which includes temporary data merged from database)
var comment by remember(network.bssid, network.comment) { mutableStateOf(network.comment) }
var savedPassword by remember(network.bssid, network.password) { mutableStateOf(network.password ?: "") }
var photoUri by remember(network.bssid, network.photoPath) { 
    mutableStateOf<Uri?>(network.photoPath?.let { Uri.parse(it) }) 
}

// Update local state when network data changes (includes temporary data)
LaunchedEffect(network.comment, network.password, network.photoPath) {
    comment = network.comment
    savedPassword = network.password ?: ""
    photoUri = network.photoPath?.let { Uri.parse(it) }
}
```

### 3. Data Persistence Flow (Already Working)
The MainViewModel already had the correct flow:

1. **Data Storage**: When user adds comment/password/image → `updateTemporaryNetworkData()` → saves to database
2. **Data Retrieval**: Raw networks from scanner + temporary data from database → merged in `enhancedNetworks` flow
3. **Data Restoration**: Enhanced networks passed to UI components → data automatically restored

```kotlin
// Enhanced networks with temporary data
private val enhancedNetworks = combine(
    rawWifiNetworks,
    manageTemporaryNetworkDataUseCase.getAllTemporaryData()
) { networks, temporaryDataList ->
    val temporaryDataMap = temporaryDataList.associateBy { it.bssid }
    networks.map { network ->
        val temporaryData = temporaryDataMap[network.bssid]
        if (temporaryData != null) {
            network.copy(
                comment = temporaryData.comment,
                password = temporaryData.savedPassword,
                photoPath = temporaryData.photoPath,
                isPinned = temporaryData.isPinned
            )
        } else {
            network
        }
    }
}.stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(), emptyList())
```

### 4. Debugging Support Added
Added logging to track data persistence:

**TemporaryNetworkDataRepositoryImpl.kt:**
- Added debug logs to track when data is saved/retrieved
- Helps verify that persistence is working correctly

**MainViewModel.kt:**
- Added logging when `updateTemporaryNetworkData` is called

### 5. How It Works Now

#### When User Adds Data:
1. User adds comment/password/image on network card
2. `onUpdateNetworkData` callback triggered
3. `MainViewModel.updateTemporaryNetworkData()` called
4. Data saved to database via `ManageTemporaryNetworkDataUseCase`

#### When Scan Refreshes:
1. `scanWifiNetworksUseCase.clearNetworks()` clears in-memory network list
2. New scan discovers networks again
3. `enhancedNetworks` flow automatically combines new networks with existing temporary data from database
4. UI receives networks with restored comments/passwords/images
5. Network cards display the persisted data

#### Data Persistence:
- **Comments**: Persist across scan refreshes ✅
- **Passwords**: Persist across scan refreshes ✅  
- **Images**: Persist across scan refreshes ✅
- **Pin Status**: Persist across scan refreshes ✅
- **App Restarts**: All data persists in SQLite database ✅

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start a WiFi scan** and find a network
2. **Add a comment** to the network (without pinning)
3. **Add a password** to the network (without pinning)
4. **Take a photo** of the network (without pinning)
5. **Refresh the scan** (tap Stop then Start)
6. **Verify** that the comment, password, and photo are still there

The data should persist even if:
- The scan is refreshed multiple times
- The app is closed and reopened
- The device is rebooted

## Architecture Benefits

This implementation provides:
- **Automatic persistence** for all network data
- **Efficient data merging** using Kotlin Flows
- **Clean separation** between pinned and temporary data
- **Robust error handling** with nullable type safety
- **Performance optimization** with database indexing on BSSID

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Data cleanup**: Automatically remove old temporary data after X days
- **Export functionality**: Include temporary data in network exports
- **Sync capability**: Backup temporary data to cloud storage
- **Bulk operations**: Mass edit/delete temporary data
