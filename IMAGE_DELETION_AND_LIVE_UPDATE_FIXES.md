# Image Deletion and Live Update Fixes Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Attached Image Removal Not Working
**Problem**: When a user removed an attached image from a Wi-Fi card, it was automatically restored on the next scan.

**Root Cause**: The WiFi scanner was preserving existing network data (including images) when processing scan results, causing deleted images to reappear.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Modified WifiScanner.kt**: Removed preservation of temporary data like passwords, comments, and photos in `processScanResults()`. These are now handled exclusively through the temporary data storage system.
- **Enhanced MainViewModel.kt**: Added proper image file deletion when `photoPath` is set to null, ensuring both database and file system cleanup.
- **Updated ManageTemporaryNetworkDataUseCase.kt**: Added `explicitPhotoPathUpdate` parameter to handle explicit null values for photo deletion.

### 2. Live Update for Pinned Cards
**Problem**: Changes made to pinned network cards in the main list were not immediately reflected in the Pinned screen.

**Root Cause**: No synchronization mechanism between temporary network data and pinned network data.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Created SyncNetworkDataUseCase.kt**: New use case that provides live-updating pinned networks by combining data from both pinned networks and temporary data repositories.
- **Updated MainViewModel.kt**: 
  - Added SyncNetworkDataUseCase dependency
  - Replaced static pinned networks flow with live-updating version
  - Enhanced temporary data updates to also sync with pinned networks when applicable

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **WifiScanner.kt**
   - Removed `password = existingNetwork?.password` preservation
   - Now returns clean network data without temporary information
   - Temporary data is merged later in the ViewModel layer

2. **MainViewModel.kt**
   - Added `SyncNetworkDataUseCase` dependency
   - Enhanced `updateTemporaryNetworkData()` with proper image deletion
   - Updated pinned networks flow to use live-updating version
   - Added file system cleanup for deleted images

3. **ManageTemporaryNetworkDataUseCase.kt**
   - Added `explicitPhotoPathUpdate` parameter to `saveOrUpdateTemporaryNetworkData()`
   - Handles explicit null values for photo path updates

4. **SyncNetworkDataUseCase.kt** (New)
   - Provides `getPinnedNetworksWithLiveUpdates()` method
   - Combines pinned networks with latest temporary data
   - Ensures real-time synchronization across screens

### Data Flow

1. **Image Deletion**:
   - User removes image → `updateTemporaryNetworkData()` called with `photoPath = null`
   - Physical file deleted from storage
   - Database updated with `photoPath = null` and `explicitPhotoPathUpdate = true`
   - If network is pinned, pinned network data also updated
   - Next scan doesn't restore the image because scanner no longer preserves temporary data

2. **Live Updates**:
   - User modifies pinned network in main screen
   - Temporary data updated immediately
   - `SyncNetworkDataUseCase` combines pinned networks with latest temporary data
   - Pinned screen automatically reflects changes through reactive data flow

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Image Deletion**: Once deleted, images stay deleted across app sessions and scans
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes in main screen immediately appear in pinned screen
3. **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth for network modifications
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated sync use case
5. **File System Cleanup**: Prevents storage bloat by properly deleting image files

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Image Deletion Test**:
   - Attach image to network
   - Delete image
   - Perform new scan
   - Verify image doesn't reappear

2. **Live Update Test**:
   - Pin a network
   - Modify comment/password/image in main screen
   - Navigate to pinned screen
   - Verify changes are immediately visible

3. **Cross-Screen Consistency**:
   - Make changes in main screen
   - Verify pinned screen updates
   - Make changes in pinned screen (if applicable)
   - Verify main screen updates

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Image deletion with file system cleanup
- Live update synchronization
- Data flow architecture
- Kotlin compilation successful

⚠️ **Notes**:
- Lint errors present but unrelated to implemented changes
- All core functionality implemented and compiling
- Ready for testing and deployment
