# Settings Fixes Implementation Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to address the issues with max retries, connection timeout, and SharedPreferences usage in the WiMap application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Max Retries Not Respected ✅
**Problem**: When "Max Retries" was set to 1, the app still tried 3 times instead of honoring the user setting.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ConnectionManager.kt` to properly use the `_maxRetries.value` from SharedPreferences
- Fixed the retry logic to ensure each password gets exactly the specified number of attempts
- Added proper bounds checking (1-10 retries) with `coerceIn(1, 10)`
- Implemented real-time updates to ConnectionManager when settings change

**Key Changes**:
```kotlin
// Each password gets exactly maxRetries attempts, no more, no less
for (retry in 1..maxRetries) {
    // Connection attempt logic
    if (retry < maxRetries) {
        // Show retry message only if more attempts remain
    }
}
```

### 2. Connection Timeout Issues ✅
**Problem**: The timeout per attempt didn't match user-defined settings and could be hardcoded or overridden.

**Solution**:
- Updated timeout logic to strictly use `_connectionTimeoutSeconds.value` from SharedPreferences
- Added bounds checking (5-60 seconds) with `coerceIn(5, 60)`
- Implemented precise timeout handling in `attemptConnectionWithRetry()`
- Ensured timeout is never exceeded, even if system connection fails earlier

**Key Changes**:
```kotlin
val maxWaitTime = timeoutSeconds * 1000L
while (elapsedTime < maxWaitTime) {
    delay(checkInterval)
    elapsedTime += checkInterval.toInt()
    // Check connection status
}
```

### 3. SharedPreferences Implementation ✅
**Problem**: Settings were not properly stored in or loaded from SharedPreferences.

**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive SharedPreferences management in `MainViewModel.kt`
- Added proper loading and saving methods for all settings
- Ensured settings are loaded on app startup and saved immediately when changed
- Added real-time updates to ConnectionManager when settings change

**Key Methods Added**:
```kotlin
private fun loadConnectionSettingsFromPreferences()
private fun saveConnectionSettingsToPreferences()
private fun loadPasswordsFromPreferences()
private fun savePasswordsToPreferences()
private fun loadFiltersFromPreferences()
private fun saveFiltersToPreferences()
```

### 4. Parameter Usage Verification ✅
**Problem**: Values used in scan and connection logic were cached or hardcoded instead of being pulled from SharedPreferences.

**Solution**:
- Updated all connection logic to use live values from StateFlow
- Implemented `updateConnectionSettings()` method to push changes to ConnectionManager
- Added proper data flow: Settings UI → ViewModel → Repository → ConnectionManager
- Ensured no hardcoded values remain in connection logic

### 5. String Resources ✅
**Problem**: Some strings were hardcoded in the code instead of being in strings.xml.

**Solution**:
- Added 40+ new string resources to `strings.xml`
- Externalized all hardcoded strings related to connection messages
- Added proper string formatting for dynamic content
- Ensured all user-facing text is localizable

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Flow
```
SettingsScreen → MainViewModel → ConnectToNetworkUseCase → WifiRepository → ConnectionManager
                      ↓
                SharedPreferences (persistent storage)
```

### Key Files Modified

1. **MainViewModel.kt**
   - Added comprehensive SharedPreferences management
   - Implemented proper settings loading/saving
   - Added real-time updates to connection components

2. **ConnectionManager.kt**
   - Fixed retry logic to respect max retries setting
   - Updated timeout handling to use user-defined values
   - Removed hardcoded connection parameters

3. **ConnectToNetworkUseCase.kt**
   - Added `updateConnectionSettings()` method
   - Ensured proper data flow from ViewModel to ConnectionManager

4. **WifiRepository.kt & WifiRepositoryImpl.kt**
   - Added interface and implementation for connection settings updates
   - Maintained clean separation of concerns

5. **strings.xml**
   - Added 40+ new string resources
   - Externalized all hardcoded connection-related strings

### Settings Persistence

All settings are now properly stored in SharedPreferences with these keys:
- `max_retries` (Int, default: 3, range: 1-10)
- `connection_timeout_seconds` (Int, default: 10, range: 5-60)
- `rssi_threshold_for_connection` (Int, default: -70, range: -100 to -30)
- `hide_networks_unseen_for_hours` (Int, default: 24)
- `stored_passwords` (String, comma-separated)
- `ssid_filter`, `security_filter`, `rssi_threshold`, `bssid_filter`
- `sorting_mode` (String)

### Real-time Updates

When users change settings:
1. UI immediately reflects the change
2. Value is saved to SharedPreferences
3. ConnectionManager is updated with new values
4. Next connection attempt uses the new settings

## Testing Verification

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Max Retries Test**:
   - Set max retries to 1 in settings
   - Attempt connection with wrong password
   - Verify only 1 attempt is made per password

2. **Timeout Test**:
   - Set connection timeout to 5 seconds
   - Attempt connection to non-existent network
   - Verify timeout occurs after exactly 5 seconds

3. **Persistence Test**:
   - Change settings values
   - Force-close and restart app
   - Verify settings are preserved

4. **Real-time Updates Test**:
   - Change settings while connection is in progress
   - Verify next connection uses new settings

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing SharedPreferences keys are preserved
- Default values are provided for new settings
- Legacy data is properly migrated

## Performance Impact

The implementation has minimal performance impact:
- Settings are loaded once on app startup
- SharedPreferences operations are asynchronous
- No blocking operations on main thread
- Efficient data flow with StateFlow

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been comprehensively addressed:
- ✅ Max retries are now properly respected
- ✅ Connection timeout matches user settings exactly
- ✅ All settings use SharedPreferences correctly
- ✅ No hardcoded values remain in connection logic
- ✅ All strings are properly externalized

The implementation follows Android best practices and maintains clean architecture principles while ensuring robust settings management and connection behavior.
