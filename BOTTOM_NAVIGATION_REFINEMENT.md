# Bottom Navigation Bar Refinement

## Overview
The bottom navigation bar has been completely redesigned to provide a clean, modern look that follows Material 3 design principles while integrating the scan button seamlessly within the bar structure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Integrated Design Approach**
- **Removed**: Floating Action Button (FAB) with notched bottom bar
- **Added**: Integrated scan button that sits flush within the navigation bar
- **Result**: Clean, unified navigation experience without visual disruption

### 2. **Modern Material 3 Styling**
- **Surface Container**: Uses `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceContainer` for proper Material 3 theming
- **Tonal Elevation**: Applied 3dp tonal elevation with 8dp shadow elevation for depth
- **Color Scheme**: Fully integrated with Material 3 dynamic color system
- **Typography**: Uses Material 3 typography scales with proper font weights

### 3. **Enhanced Scan Button Integration**
- **Prominent Position**: Centered in the navigation bar for easy access
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Larger size (56dp) compared to other nav buttons (24dp icons)
- **State-Aware Design**: 
  - **Scanning State**: Error container colors with stop icon
  - **Idle State**: Primary container colors with play arrow icon
- **Enhanced Shadows**: Dynamic shadow elevation and ambient colors based on state
- **Smooth Interactions**: Proper click handling with visual feedback

### 4. **Balanced Navigation Layout**
- **5-Button Layout**: Evenly distributed for visual balance
  1. Share (Export functionality)
  2. Clear (Clear networks)
  3. **Scan** (Primary action - prominent)
  4. Maps (Navigation to maps view)
  5. More (Additional features/settings)

### 5. **Improved Button Design**
- **Consistent Sizing**: All navigation buttons follow the same size constraints
- **Rounded Corners**: 12dp rounded corners for modern touch targets
- **Proper Spacing**: Optimized padding and margins for comfortable interaction
- **Icon + Label**: Clear iconography with descriptive labels below
- **Accessibility**: Proper content descriptions and touch targets

### 6. **Visual Refinements**
- **Height Optimization**: Reduced from 88dp to 80dp for better proportions
- **Padding Adjustments**: Optimized horizontal (12dp) and vertical (8dp) padding
- **Color Consistency**: Uses theme-aware colors throughout
- **Shadow Effects**: Subtle shadows for depth without overwhelming the design
